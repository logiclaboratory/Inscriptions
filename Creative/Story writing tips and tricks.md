## Starting a scene

The beginning of a scene should establish where, when, and what.

Know the core of the scene and get to that point as quickly as possible.

Consider opening a scene with an image or narrative instead of a dialogue.

Get in late, get out early - Start the scenes as late as possible, and get out early. Movies are a great way to learn this. Pay attention to screen breaks in movies.

## Show the story. Don't tell

Showing describes by use of details, actions, or images. Try to paint a picture with a description of the details.

#### Examples: 

**Telling:** Sarah was terrified of spiders. Whenever she saw one, she wanted to scream.

**Showing:** As the spider crawled down from the ceiling, Sarah pressed her back against the far wall. Even though it was across the room, her skin scuttled as if its legs were scrambling all over her. She breathed so quickly she felt like she wasn't breathing at all. On the wall, its shadow was ten times larger than the arachnid itself, its legs looking sharp and demonic.

**Telling:** The man was stressed.

**Showing:** The man was fidgeting and biting his nails.

**Telling:** The room was messy

**Showing:** There was leftover pizza, dirty clothes strewn ...

**Telling:** The woman was confident.

**Showing:** She strode into the room and everyone turned their head to notice her.

**Telling:** The stadium was full.

**Showing:** The sound from the stadium was deafening.

**Telling:** It was cold.

**Showing:** Drain pipes were freezing

**Telling:** The castle was captured

**Showing:** The new flag was hoisted, greeted by a cheer from the crowd.

#### Effective ways to tell

- Choose the most effective details
- Create a rich setting
- Use dialogue to reveal character
- Use showing to be subtle with theme
- Use figurative language carefully. Don't overdo. Don't show what is already shown.
- Don't label emotions. Don't use sentences like - He was sad(Telling).

Use telling effectively in a minimal way when it is very much required.

## Introducing characters

- Give every character their moment 
  - Don't introduce more than one character at a time. Gives more clarity.
- Using specific details. Choose strong details about the character(Appearance, dressing, mannerism, something they carry, something they say)
- Show, don’t tell (Clothing show the lifestyle, Mannerisms can show the personality, Expressions can show their attitude) 
- Use your protagonist’s worldview (Show the world through the eye of the protagonist.) Use the narrator's personality and judgment as a way to showcase both characters.
- Avoid introducing a character with a dialogue. (Not a rule. But better to do this.)
-  Include a physical description. Plays an important role in introducing side characters.
- Introduce the main character first.
  - Use a narrative voice to introduce the main character.
  - Character's tone is an important tool
- Create an active beginning. helps to establish the character, Start with an active moment which will help establish the character.
- Using exposition smartly, but sparingly. Use telling wisely.
- Introduce the character flaw. Show the flaw of the main character and how it impacts his/her life. Show rather than tell.
- Focus on the relationship. Focus on the relationship between secondary characters and the main character. Don't get lost in establishing the second character's traits too much.
- Explore the existing tension in the relationship between characters.
- Use flashbacks. Use half scenes. Start from the middle of a scene and establish the scene with flashbacks and move forward with the scene.
- Physical descriptions. When the main character meets a new character he/she does not know, it is always better to start with the physical description of the character and what first impression the new character creates in the main character.
- Setup the future dynamic. Use the assumptions of the characters.
- Make it memorable. 

## Plotting tips

- Genre awareness. Make a satisfying plot in than genre is really important. Know your genre well and have an awareness of what your audience finds satisfying.
- Change and growth.  How the story changes and how the plot grows. A story means a change. If a moment does not add to a change, don't include it. 
- Set up and payoff. Reuse objects. This essentially means that elements introduced into your story  (probably at the beginning), are important later on (probably at the end), and ideally in a logical but unexpected way.
- Unpredictable. Avoid clenches. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to throw in a bunch of plot twists, but the plot should be one that is not easily anticipated.
- Causality. Every scene is necessitated by the previous scene. There should be a cause for that scene. Ask questions. What happens in the next scene. Should this be there if the previous scene was not there.  The strongest possible structure is one where you cannot remove or move a single scene without disrupting the entire story irreparably. Scenes should have a domino effect so that each causes the next. 
- Mystery and revelation. Set up questions and try to answer them with a mix of mystery and revelation.
- Suspense and snap. The eagerness of what will happen next. Bring people into the story. The key to suspense is to set up a question(or several) that the audience hopes to get an answer to; and delays it while maintaining their interest and keeping them guessing.
- Use dramatic irony. Don't keep the audience in the dark forever. Sometimes suspense is best served by revealing key parts to the audience but not to the characters.
- Limit the point of view. Use the character's lack of knowledge as a tool and make the character find the answer for the reader. 
- Emotional balance and cohesion. There should always be hope and despair in the story. The key is finding a balance between emotional variety (so, not too much hope or there’s no tension, not too much despair or there’s no possibility for a change), while still having a cohesive plot where all the threads feed into each other.
- Unrest and resolution.  Think of the entire plot as being a period of unrest for the characters, and the resolution being a period of rest.

## How to write strong dialogues

- Intuitive - Dialogues should be intuitive and natural.
- Should reveal character and character relationships.
- Say interesting things. Hilarious, insightful, philosophical, rude, etc.
- Make strong use of subtext.
- Feels natural without trying to do the acting
- Characters have distinct voices.
- Think of fiction dialogue as a shorthand for real dialogue. Characters will express the same ideas, but with fewer words. 
- Avoids trigger phrases. If your character needs to say something, have them say it without having a trigger phrase from another character.  Things like “And then what?” “What do you mean?” Even the unassuming “What?” or “Yeah?” are all trigger phrases. 
- Ideal fiction dialogue is pared down, clean, and charged with character relationships rather than plot since the plot is going to be mostly held up by the narrative. 

## Mistakes to avoid

Not giving the character anything active to do. 

Trying to do too much. Limit the number of characters.

Not having a specific focus.

Withhold too much information

Lack of strong title or the first sentence

Choosing a protagonist without something interesting to offer
